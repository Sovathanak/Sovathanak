- 👋 Hi, I’m Nick. I'm a recent IT graduate from Monash University.
- 💞️ I’m keen on working on projects  big or small with a team and independently with a focus on AI, Machine Learning, Data Visualizations, etc. I'm currently working on a project called SummarAIze, a Machine Learning model that summarizes a body of text into a few sentences. 
to make predictions. Examples: Stock market prices, price changes on a certain product, weather, etc.
