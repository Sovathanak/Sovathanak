- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sovathanak. I'm a university student who is just starting out with working on projects on the side while studying. 
- 👀 I’m mostly using python when working the projects, I'm currently studying some libraries such as pygame, selenium and tensorflow.
- 💞️ I’m also keen on working on big projects with a team which focuses on A.I. Some of the projects I'm currently interested in are creating machine learning models
to make predictions. Examples: Stock market prices, price changes on a certain product, weather, etc.
- 📫 You can reach me through email: msovathanak@gmail.com
